## Initial Project Ideas

1️⃣ **DermHub using Node.js + ChatGPT API**  
A version of DermHub where customer-submitted skin concerns are processed using the ChatGPT API. Instead of waiting for a dermatologist, the AI responds with the most likely issue and recommended remedies automatically.

2️⃣ **DermHub using Flask (Selected Concept)**  
DermHub is an online consultation platform helping customers reach board-certified dermatologists within hours. Using Flask for the backend and Mailgun to implement communication between the patient and the admin dermatologists.

3️⃣ **Restaurant Tracking App for Sales Prospecting**  
An application that tracks restaurants in a specific area that use DoorDash/Grubhub by leveraging the Google Maps API. This tool would streamline prospecting for Uber Eats sales representatives by identifying leads more efficiently.
